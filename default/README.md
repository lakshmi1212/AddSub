- `tests/test_add.py`: Contains test cases for the addition function.
- `tests/test_subtract.py`: Contains test cases for the subtraction function.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the tests.
- `math.json`: Contains metadata for CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the tests using `pytest`.

## CI/CD Workflow:

This repository includes metadata for setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs tests automatically on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

## Requirements:
