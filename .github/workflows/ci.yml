# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# CI Pipeline for Python Project: lakshmi1212/AddSub
#
# This workflow runs pytest-based tests on every push and PR to main.
# It ensures code quality, reliability, and fast feedback for developers.
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If the job fails, review the detailed pytest output in the Actions log.
# - Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
# - To debug, rerun failed jobs with debug logging enabled.
#
# OPTIMIZATION & SCALABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
# - For large test suites, consider test parallelization (e.g., pytest-xdist).
# - Add caching for pip dependencies to speed up installs.
# - Integrate code coverage (e.g., pytest-cov) for quality metrics.
# - Use GitHub Environments for deployment workflows.

    # FAILURE HANDLING:
    # - The job fails if any pytest test fails (non-zero exit code).
    # - Pytest output is available in the Actions UI for diagnosis.

    # REPORTING:
    # - Pytest output will be shown in the GitHub Actions logs.
    # - For advanced reporting, integrate pytest-html or upload artifacts.
